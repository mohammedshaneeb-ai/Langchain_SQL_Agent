# Langchain_SQL_Agent

Enterprise data is often stored in SQL databases.

LLMs make it possible to interact with SQL databases using natural langugae.

LangChain offers SQL Chains and Agents to build and run SQL queries based on natural language prompts.

These are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite).

They enable use cases such as:

  Generating queries that will be run based on natural language questions
  Creating chatbots that can answer questions based on database data
  Building custom dashboards based on insights a user wants to analyze
